      <h3>Dred Review app Test Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        <Strong>Before everything, </Strong> I want to thank you for having dedicated some time to me in the screening process. In the following demonstration,
        I created a small application for the user to make a review about a specific product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application was created with the following technologies:
        <ul>
          <li>Python (v3.x) for provider the backend</li>
          <li>Angular (v1.6) for provider the front and bussines logic, build using ES6 Classes</li>
          <li>Gulp for the pipeline</li>
          <li>Material design lite for provider the front and UI</li>
          <li>Docker for provider the DEV env and also can using for Prod env </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
